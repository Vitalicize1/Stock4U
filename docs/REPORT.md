## Stock4U Project Report

### Abstract
Stock4U is a multi‑agent, AI‑powered stock analysis platform that integrates technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and large language model (LLM) reasoning to generate actionable market insights. The system orchestrates specialized agents in a LangGraph workflow to collect market data, compute indicators, assess sentiment, integrate signals, and produce a final prediction with confidence and risk context. Users interact via a Streamlit dashboard and an AI chatbot, with optional API access. The platform emphasizes modularity, reliability, and educational value, supporting both quick evaluations and deeper analysis. Performance targets include timely responses, accuracy, and robust error handling.

### Description
Stock4U combines a layered architecture—data collection, analysis, prediction, and interfaces—coordinated by an orchestrator. Agents perform focused tasks: the Data Collector retrieves market and company data; the Technical Analyzer computes indicators and patterns; the Sentiment Analyzer evaluates news and social signals; the Sentiment Integrator reconciles signals; and the Prediction Agent produces a reasoned forecast. Outputs are delivered through a Streamlit dashboard for visualization and a chatbot for conversational exploration. The system is implemented in Python with LangGraph/LangChain, Pandas/NumPy, and yfinance, with optional integrations for LLMs and web search.

### Objectives
- Provide reliable direction predictions with clear confidence and rationale
- Offer comprehensive analysis that fuses technicals, sentiment, and market context
- Deliver user‑friendly interfaces (dashboard and chatbot) for discovery and explanation
- Maintain a modular, testable architecture for scalability and evolution
- Support learning and experimentation through transparent metrics and artifacts

### Scope
- In scope:
  - Multi‑agent analysis pipeline (collection → technical → sentiment → integration → prediction)
  - Streamlit dashboard with visualizations and analysis summaries
  - Chatbot interface for natural‑language exploration
  - Optional API/CLI entry points for programmatic use
  - Local/Docker deployments with caching, basic auth, and monitoring scaffolding
  - Backtesting and calibration utilities where provided in the codebase
- Out of scope (current release):
  - Automated trading/execution and brokerage integrations
  - Financial advice or investment guarantees
  - High‑frequency/low‑latency trading use cases
  - Proprietary premium data sources unless configured by the user
