## Stock4U Project Report

### Abstract
Stock4U is a multi‑agent, AI‑powered stock analysis platform that integrates technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and large language model (LLM) reasoning to generate actionable market insights. The system orchestrates specialized agents in a LangGraph workflow to collect market data, compute indicators, assess sentiment, integrate signals, and produce a final prediction with confidence and risk context. Users interact via a Streamlit dashboard and an AI chatbot, with optional API access. The platform emphasizes modularity, reliability, and educational value, supporting both quick evaluations and deeper analysis. Performance targets include timely responses, accuracy, and robust error handling.

### Description
Stock4U is an end‑to‑end stock analysis and prediction application that turns a user’s ticker input into an actionable outlook with quantified confidence, risk, and a plain‑language explanation. The system orchestrates specialized agents to collect market data, compute technical indicators, assess news/Reddit sentiment, and fuse these signals into a single decision score. Results are presented in an interactive dashboard and chatbot, and are also available through a programmatic API that mirrors the dashboard’s schema.

Under the hood, the Orchestrator validates inputs and environment flags, then delegates to the Data Collector to retrieve OHLCV, company, and market context from Yahoo Finance with automatic cache fallback on timeouts or rate limits. The Technical Analyzer derives a broad set of indicators and trading signals, while the Sentiment Analyzer estimates market mood from NewsAPI and Reddit (with optional Tavily search). The Sentiment Integrator aligns and weights these modalities to produce a coherent integrated score with confidence and risk. A configurable Prediction Agent then forms the final outlook using an ensemble of ML and rules, optionally augmented by LLM reasoning; if LLMs are disabled or quota‑limited, the ensemble transparently falls back to ML + rules. The Elicitation component converts the analysis into a concise explanation, and an Evaluator‑Optimizer periodically reviews outcomes to tune parameters and maintain calibration.

The application is designed for resilience and transparency: provider issues trigger retries and cache usage with freshness tagging; unavailable modalities (for example, sentiment or limited history) are clearly indicated while the system continues in a degraded but reliable mode. Observability is built in through structured logs, latency and cache metrics, and model/version identifiers, while authenticated endpoints and redaction policies protect secrets and user data. Typical requests complete within a few seconds in low‑API mode and under ten seconds in full mode. Stock4U focuses on single‑ticker analysis and reporting; it does not execute trades or perform portfolio optimization, but it provides a clear, reproducible basis for investor decisions across dashboard, chatbot, and API interfaces.

### Objectives
- Provide reliable direction predictions with clear confidence and rationale
- Offer comprehensive analysis that fuses technicals, sentiment, and market context
- Deliver user‑friendly interfaces (dashboard and chatbot) for discovery and explanation
- Maintain a modular, testable architecture for scalability and evolution
- Support learning and experimentation through transparent metrics and artifacts

### Scope
- In scope:
  - Multi‑agent analysis pipeline (collection → technical → sentiment → integration → prediction)
  - Streamlit dashboard with visualizations and analysis summaries
  - Chatbot interface for natural‑language exploration
  - Optional API/CLI entry points for programmatic use
  - Local/Docker deployments with caching, basic auth, and monitoring scaffolding
  - Backtesting and calibration utilities where provided in the codebase
- Out of scope (current release):
  - Automated trading/execution and brokerage integrations
  - Financial advice or investment guarantees
  - High‑frequency/low‑latency trading use cases
  - Proprietary premium data sources unless configured by the user
